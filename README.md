# xxxxtale Engine

An Undertale engine in godot. This was my first real project.
This engine is a base for any of your undertale fangame, letting you focus on your patterns,stories  instead of bow to make turn based fight.

## Features

- **Overworld template**
- **Cutscene template**
- **Battle/Attacks template**
- **Flexible attacks with pre attack events, pre patterns events, post attack events**
- **Everything as ressource**: Your battles, weapons, characters, etc are all customizable ressource.
- **Battle management**: With battles continuity for a highly flexible way to describe how you want your battles to go.
- **Efficient turn based systems**: Using multiples trigger to manage the different states of the fight.
- **Easy dialogue system**: No hardcoding here, load your dialogues from a separate in a completely human readable way
- **Object as CVS**: Load your objects from CSV files, you created a new kind of weapon ? Just add it in that CVS bro and you're done.
- **Custom collision system**: Instead of relying on Godot collisions systems which may not suit the intensity of your fangame, a custom collision system has been implemented specifically for undertale.
- **Powerful text writer**: That has his own little DSL to create powerful text and even trigger events from them.
